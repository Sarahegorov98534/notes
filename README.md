- "Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build bigger and better idiot-proof programs, and the universe trying to produce bigger and better idiots. So far, the universe is winning." - Rich Cook

This quote humorously highlights the importance of considering the end-users when developing software. No matter how robust and well-designed a program may be, there will always be users who manage to find ways to misuse or break it. As programmers, we must strive to create intuitive and user-friendly interfaces, provide clear instructions and error messages, and anticipate potential issues to minimize user-induced problems.
