- Today's programming wisdom is: "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. In software development, strive to write clear, concise code that's easy to read, understand, and maintain. This often involves making deliberate choices about abstraction, modularization, and avoiding unnecessary complexity. Always remember that code is read far more than it's written, and tomorrow's you (or your fellow developers) will thank you for it." 

In practice, this means adhering to principles like KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid), DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), and YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It). Continuously refactor your code to improve its clarity and efficiency, and embrace testing as a means to ensure code quality and minimize bugs. Lastly, remember that good design and architecture are just as important as the actual coding, as they lay the groundwork for long-term success and scalability of your software projects.
